// Like a bit of a macro - lets you do almost anything
// Compiler will write code for you based on a set of rules
#include <iostream>

// A good example is if we have a function that we want to take in different types
void Print(int value) {
	std::cout << value << std::endl;
}

// Now what if we want to print a string too? Then we'd have to do an overload



int main() {
	

}
